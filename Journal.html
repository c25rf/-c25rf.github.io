Entry 1: 10/4

In CS1 So far, I’ve learned about HTML websites, sublime text, and how to create images inside my website. I have really enjoyed making my website and exploring the different options about how to format my website and projects within sublime text. I am currently working on setting up my website and making sure all the links work to the different parts of the website. After that I will start making projects and I hope to make something for my little sister who is 9 years old. I am frustrated about how precise coding has to be to work but I am also excited that I will be challenged with making my website interesting. I also hope to start projects and continue developing my website in the coming weeks. I’m so excited for CS1!
