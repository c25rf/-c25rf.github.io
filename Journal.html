Entry 1:

In CS1 So far, I’ve learned about HTML websites, sublime text, and how to create images inside my website. I have really enjoyed making my website and exploring the different options about how to format my website and projects within sublime text. I am currently working on setting up my website and making sure all the links work to the different parts of the website. After that I will start making projects and I hope to make something for my little sister who is 9 years old. I am frustrated about how precise coding has to be to work but I am also excited that I will be challenged with making my website interesting. I also hope to start projects and continue developing my website in the coming weeks. I’m so excited for CS1!

Entry 2:

This week I made a project. It was Tom Thibodeau laughing maniacally. It was deemed creepy by many people. I have begun to enjoy making my website and updating the new components. This week I made my website the butt fumble. That was a terrible time for us Jets fans. Actually, every season is terrible for Jets fans. But, I hope to start another project soon. I am either going to make one for my sister or my uncle. I think I might make one for my uncle first because it is easier but I’ll see. That’s all for this entry.

Entry 3:

This week I made 2 more codesketches. Javascript is going well. A variable in Javascript is something that defines a word, it is kind of like a div. A function is like the style section of a div. It is what describes what something does, and how it does it. You can run a function by making it run after an action or setting an interval to make it run after a certain amount of time. In Java, I’ve learned how to make a function and how to run it. In my codesketches, I use my function to do an action after I click.

Entry 4:

Right now I am working on a present for my uncle. It is for Thanksgiving and I am very excited to finish it. This past week I learned about javascript functions and how to make my website respond to things like clicks, presses of the space key and more.

Entry 5:

I am currently working on a hannukkah gift for my sister, I hope that I'll be able to get it done soon. It is a thing that uses the template of the Ninja Turtles being young and old but with her stiffed animals.

Entry 6:

Today I made a function that uses arrays. It was one of my first experiences with arrays and it was cool to use. I struggled a little at the beginning but I ended with a functioning codesketch.

Entry 7:

This week I made a digital appreciation card for Vihaan. I used an event listener to print a picture of him every time I click and I used the hover function to create an inside joke. It was really fun to do!

Questions:

How do you get an image to follow your cursor?
What is the difference between = and ==?
Do you have to make the position absolute to get top and left to work?
How do you center text on the top of the screen?
What are all the ways to run a function?
How do you change the positioning of certain divs?
How do if-else statements work and can there be multiple relating to the same variables?
How does a loop work and how do you make it?
Why are there different code languages, why can’t it all be packed into one specific one?
What are more complicated/cool things that can be done with arrays?
