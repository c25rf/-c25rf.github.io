Entry 1: 10/4

In CS1 So far, I’ve learned about HTML websites, sublime text, and how to create images inside my website. I have really enjoyed making my website and exploring the different options about how to format my website and projects within sublime text. I am currently working on setting up my website and making sure all the links work to the different parts of the website. After that I will start making projects and I hope to make something for my little sister who is 9 years old. I am frustrated about how precise coding has to be to work but I am also excited that I will be challenged with making my website interesting. I also hope to start projects and continue developing my website in the coming weeks. I’m so excited for CS1!

Entry 2: 10/22

This week I made a project. It was Tom Thibodeau laughing maniacally. It was deemed creepy by many people. I have begun to enjoy making my website and updating the new components. This week I made my website the butt fumble. That was a terrible time for us Jets fans. Actually, every season is terrible for Jets fans. But, I hope to start another project soon. I am either going to make one for my sister or my uncle. I think I might make one for my uncle first because it is easier but I’ll see. That’s all for this entry.

Entry 3: 11/1

This week I made 2 more codesketches. Javascript is going well. A variable in Javascript is something that defines a word, it is kind of like a div. A function is like the style section of a div. It is what describes what something does, and how it does it. You can run a function by making it run after an action or setting an interval to make it run after a certain amount of time. In Java, I’ve learned how to make a function and how to run it. In my codesketches, I use my function to do an action after I click.

Entry 4: 11/12

Right now I am working on a present for my uncle. It is for Thanksgiving and I am very excited to finish it. This past week I learned about javascript functions and how to make my website respond to things like clicks, presses of the space key and more.
