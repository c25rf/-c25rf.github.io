Entry 1: 10/4

In CS1 So far, I’ve learned about HTML websites, sublime text, and how to create images inside my website. I have really enjoyed making my website and exploring the different options about how to format my website and projects within sublime text. I am currently working on setting up my website and making sure all the links work to the different parts of the website. After that I will start making projects and I hope to make something for my little sister who is 9 years old. I am frustrated about how precise coding has to be to work but I am also excited that I will be challenged with making my website interesting. I also hope to start projects and continue developing my website in the coming weeks. I’m so excited for CS1!

Entry 2: 10/22

This week I made a project. It was Tom Thibodeau laughing maniacally. It was deemed creepy by many people. I have begun to enjoy making my website and updating the new components. This week I made my website the butt fumble. That was a terrible time for us Jets fans. Actually, every season is terrible for Jets fans. But, I hope to start another project soon. I am either going to make one for my sister or my uncle. I think I might make one for my uncle first because it is easier but I’ll see. That’s all for this entry.
